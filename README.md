# Figma to Code Demo

This project demonstrates the use of the Gemini CLI to convert a Figma design into a functional HTML, CSS, and JavaScript prototype.

## Figma Prototype

The `figma_prototype` directory contains the generated web prototype. It was created based on the Figma design file and includes the following:

-   `index.html`: The main HTML structure of the application.
-   `style.css`: The stylesheet that provides the visual appearance.
-   `script.js`: The JavaScript file for any interactive elements.
-   `assets/`: A directory containing all the image assets downloaded from Figma.

To view the prototype, open the `figma_prototype/index.html` file in a web browser.

## Mockup

The `mockup` directory contains the original design mockup for the project. The `cash_app_mockup.md` is a placeholder for the mockup file.
